# NuxtJs SSR website lambda

> [!TIP]
> To deploy this project using **GUI-based flow**, navigate to [console](https://console.stacktape.com/create-new-project/git-project-using-console?name=my-stacktape-app&repositoryType=public&repositoryUrl=https://github.com/stacktape/starter-nuxtjs-ssr-website-lambda)

- simple Server-side rendered [NuxtJS v3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) application.
- The project uses a [Lambda function](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/lambda-functions/) to run the Nuxt
  app and a [S3 storage bucket](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/buckets/) with
  [CDN](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/cdns/) to host the static content.
- This project includes a pre-configured [stacktape.yml configuration](stacktape.yml).
The configured infrastructure is described in the [stack description section](#stack-description)

## Pricing


- The infrastructure required for this application uses exclusively "serverless", pay-per-use infrastructure. If your load won't get high, these costs will be close to $0.

## 1. Generate your project
To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --starterId nuxtjs-ssr-website-lambda
```




## 2. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:
- Docker. To install Docker on your system, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).- Node.js installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

<br />

| Region name & Location     | code           |
  | -------------------------- | -------------- |
  | Europe (Ireland)           | eu-west-1      |

```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

## 3. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

- Explore your application at **mainApiGateway -> url**. The URL is printed to the terminal.


## 4. Run the application in development mode
To run functions in the development mode (remotely on AWS), you can use the
[dev command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/dev/). For example, to develop and debug lambda function `nuxtLambda`, you can use

```bash
stacktape dev --region <<your-region>> --stage <<stage>> --resourceName nuxtLambda
```

The command will:
- quickly re-build and re-deploy your new function code
- watch for the function logs and pretty-print them to the terminal

The function is rebuilt and redeployed, when you either:
- type `rs + enter` to the terminal
- use the `--watch` option and one of your source code files changes

## 5. Hotswap deploys
- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag that avoids Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.
```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

## 6. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

  Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
  pipeline and other aspects of your project.

  You can deploy your project to multiple environments (stages) - for
  example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of an project. It consists of your application
  code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

  The configuration for this project is described below.

  ## 1. Resources

  - Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
  - Stacktape resources consist of multiple underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.
### 1.1 HTTP API Gateway

API Gateway receives requests and routes them to the container.

For convenience, it has [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) allowed.

```yml
resources:
  mainApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cors:
        enabled: true
```

### 1.2 Bucket

The bucket is used to store our static assets. By putting CDN in front of the bucket, its content can be distributed
across the globe and served with minimal latencies.

New/modified static assets are automatically uploaded during deployment process.

We are also enabling cors on our bucket, to allow clients(browsers) access to the resources.

```yml
webBucket:
  type: bucket
  properties:
    cors:
      enabled: true
    directoryUpload:
      directoryPath: ./.output/public
      headersPreset: static-website
    cdn:
      enabled: true
      invalidateAfterDeploy: true
```

### 1.3 Function

Application is run in a lambda function.

The function is configured as follows:

- **Packaging** - determines how the lambda artifact is built. The easiest and most optimized way to build the lambda
  from Typescript/Javascript is using `stacktape-lambda-buildpack`. We only need to configure `entryfilePath`. Stacktape
  automatically transpiles and builds the application code with all of its dependencies, creates the lambda zip
  artifact, and uploads it to a pre-created S3 bucket on AWS. You can also use
  [other types of packaging](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/packaging/#packaging-lambda-functions).
- **Environment variables** - We are passing URL of the **static assets CDN** to the function as an environment
  variable. URL can be easily referenced using a
  [$ResourceParam() directive](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/directives/#resource-param). This directive
  accepts a resource name (`webBucket` in this case) and the name of the
  [bucket referenceable parameter](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/buckets/#referenceable-parameters) (`cdnUrl` in
  this case). If you want to learn more, refer to
  [referencing parameters](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/referencing-parameters/) guide and
  [directives](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/directives) guide.
- **Events** - Events determine how is function triggered. In this case, we are triggering the function when an event
  (HTTP request) is delivered to the HTTP API gateway. By configuring the path to `/{proxy+}` and the method to `'*'`,
  the event integration routes all requests (no matter the method or path) coming to the HTTP API Gateway to the
  function.

```yml
nuxtLambda:
  type: function
  properties:
    packaging:
      type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
      properties:
        entryfilePath: ./handler.ts
    environment:
      - name: NUXT_APP_CDN_URL
        value: $ResourceParam('webBucket', 'cdnUrl')
    events:
      - type: http-api-gateway
        properties:
          httpApiGatewayName: mainApiGateway
          method: "*"
          path: /{proxy+}
```

## 2. Application build hook

To automatically build the application before each deployment, the stacktape configuration contains a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

[Hooks](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/) specify the commands or scripts which are executed
automatically before or after command is executed (i.e every time before the stack is deployed). You can specify
reusable script in [scripts](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) section of config and reference it
inside a hook or inline script/command information directly.

```yml
scripts:
  nuxtBuild:
    executeCommand: npm run build

hooks:
  beforeDeploy:
    - executeNamedScript: nuxtBuild
```

Scripts specified in [scripts](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) section of config, can be run manually
anytime using `stp script:run` [command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/script-run/).
